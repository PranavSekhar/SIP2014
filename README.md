This is a astronomical tool created by Pranav Sekhar and Aaron Huang as part of a larger project to detect outflow from galaxies.
The tool itself, however, may be used for many purposes such as: stacking spectra of galaxies, distinguishing between different
spectra files based on certain parameters, analyzing data to seek galactic emission, error analysis and more. Please keep visiting
as we are continously working to add more features and improve the tool.
